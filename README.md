## Abstract
With approximately 5% of the U.S. population dealing with bipolar spectrum disorders, these individuals tend to struggle with their careers, abuse alcohol, and perform underwhelmingly in academics (Nusslock et al., 2009). Understanding the correlation of behavioral systems in children with relation to mood disorders such as bipolar disease (depression and mania) would improve psychological interventions for these children. This would, in turn, promote a better quality of life for children suffering from these disorders. There is plenty of research on adults regarding certain behavioral systems (such as the risk/reward system), but there is limited research studying the implications of these systems in children. Two such systems are the BIS and BAS systems. The behavioral inhibition system (BIS) is a neuropsychological system that influences individuals to avoid risks, while the behavioral approach system (BAS) promotes individuals to strive toward a goal.
